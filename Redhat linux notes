This makes the process seem as if it is the sole process running on the machine .
Different types of the kernel are :
- [ ] Monolithic kernel 
- [ ] Hybrid Kernels 
- [ ] Exo kernel
- [ ] Micro Kernels 

System Library : Is the special types of functions that are used to implement the functionality of the operating system.

Shell : It is an interface to the kernel which hides the complexity of the Krnel’s functions from the users . It takes commands from the user and executes the Kernel’s functions .

Hardware layer:  This layer consists of all peripheral devices like RAM /HDD/CPU etc.

System Utility : It provides the functionalities of an operating system to the user .
